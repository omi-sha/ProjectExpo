# Early Detection of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and  Brain Tumors using Convolutional Neural Network

For the classification of AD, Parkinson’s, and Brain tumors in the early stage, classification systems and computerized diagnostic techniques have been developed. Previously, machine learning approaches were applied to develop diagnostic systems by extracting features from neural images. Currently, deep-learning approaches have been used in many real-time medical imaging applications.

## Project Description

The main objective is to design an end-to-end framework for the early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and Brain Tumors and medical image classification for various stages. A deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), is used in this work. Four stages of the AD spectrum are multi-classified along with initial and stages of Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, separate binary medical image classifications are implemented between all three neurological disorders Different methods are used to classify the medical images and detect AD, Parkinson’s disease and Brain Tumour respectively. To seek to construct a very reliable and accurate model for the early phase detection of these diseases by merging the different datasets, applying the sophisticated image processing techniques, and ML algorithms. Our initiatives will be more significant and could lead to advancements in patient diagnostics and the healthcare industry. If this model is developed successfully, it will significantly alter how medical sciences have evolved in the future and pave the way for diagnosis. The images present in the dataset have varying brightness, colour and noise, to remove these unwanted elements from our training and testing images, we apply image filtering operations and histogram equalisation for contrast enhancement, for better identifiable features.
